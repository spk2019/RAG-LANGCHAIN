The 2023 ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup (also referred to as simply the 2023 Cricket World Cup) was the 
13th edition of the Cricket World Cup, a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament 
organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was hosted from 5 October to 19 November 2023 
across ten venues in India.  
The tournament was contested by ten national teams, maintaining the same format used in 2019. In the 
knockout stage, India and Australia beat New Zealand and South Africa respectively to advance to the 
final, played on 19 November at Narendra Modi Stadium. Australia won by 6 wickets, winning their sixth 
Cricket World Cup title.  
Virat Kohli was the player of the tournament and also scored the most runs; Mohammed Shami was the 
leading wicket-taker. A total of 1,250,307 spectators attended matches, the highest number in any Cricket
World Cup to-date.[1] The tournament final set viewership records in India, with 518 million viewers, and a
peak of 57 million streaming viewers.  
ndia’s 10-match winning run at the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 ended in the final with a six-wicket loss against Australia at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Sunday.

India started well with both bat and ball. However, a lack of boundaries and partnerships saw India get bowled out on 240 in 50 overs before composed knocks from Travis Head (137 off 120) and Marnus Labuschagne (58 not out in 110) guided Australia to their sixth ODI World Cup title in 43 overs.

This was India’s second ODI World Cup final against Australia and third in ICC events. India lost the 2003 World Cup final at Johannesburg by 125 runs and suffered a 209-run defeat in the ICC World Test Championships final earlier this year.

Put into bat first, India, champions in 1983 and 2011, started the match with attacking intent.

Rohit Sharma’s 47 off 31 gave India the perfect launchpad in the powerplay. His innings, laced with four fours and three maximums, helped India score 80 runs in the first 10 overs.

However, India’s scoring rate started to drop after Sharma fell to Glenn Maxwell’s spin in the 10th over. Travis Head took a brilliant diving catch to dismiss the Indian captain.

Shreyas Iyer was caught behind in the next over bowled by Australian captain Pat Cummins and India were reduced to 81/3 in the 11th over.

Virat Kohli (54 off 63) and KL Rahul (66 off 107) stitched together a 67-run partnership for the fourth wicket. However, the stand took its time and batted for 18 overs before Kohli lost his wicket with an inside edge on the bowling of Pat Cummins.

Australia produced a top-notch fielding effort and India were unable to find boundaries consistently. India went 16 overs without a boundary after Shreyas Iyer’s wicket. In fact, Pat Cummins (34/2) completed his quota of 10 overs without conceding a boundary. Leg spinner Adam Zampa (44/1) was economical. Though Josh Hazlewood (60/2) and Mitchell Starc (55/3) went for runs, they picked up wickets consistently to restrict India to 240.

David Warner and Travis Head hit Jasprit Bumrah for 15 runs in the first over of the Australian batting innings. Mohammed Shami dismissed David Warner in the next over but the required run-rate for Australia never went out of reach.

Jasprit Bumrah sent Mitchell Marsh (15 off 15) and Steven Smith (4 off 9) back cheaply, reducing Australia to 47/3 inside seven overs.

Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne navigated the next few overs cautiously. The pair grew in confidence but once the dew came into play at around the 20th over, the ball started coming onto the ball nicely and Travis Head unleashed a flurry of shots to help Australia inch closer to the target.

The pair took Australia within touching distance of the victory. India did get the breakthrough with the wicket of Travis Head but with Australia needing just one to win, Glenn Maxwell came in next and hit the winning runs as Australia cruised home to victory with seven overs to spare.

India came into the final with 10 wins on the trot. Kohli ended as the top-scorer at the 2023 ODI World Cup with 765 runs while Mohammed Shami, with 24 wickets, was the top wicket-taker in the 2023 ODI World Cup.

India vs Australia brief scores: India 240/10 (KL Rahul 66, Virat Kohli 54; Mitchell Starc 3/55) lost to Australia 241/4 (Travis Head 137, Marnus Labuschagne 58*; Jasprit Bumrah 2/43) by six wickets.
This was the first ICC World Cup in which penalties for slow over-rates were given to bowling sides if they
did not complete their 50 overs in the stipulated time. On-field umpires could penalise the bowling team 
by not allowing more than four fielders outside the 30-yard circle.[13]  
Other than India, who qualified as hosts, all teams had to qualify for the tournament through the 2023 
Cricket World Cup qualification process. Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand, 
Pakistan and South Africa qualified via the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, with the Netherlands 
and Sri Lanka securing the final two places via the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe during 
June and July 2023.  
As a result of the qualifying process, the competition was the first not to include former winners West 
Indies, who failed to progress for the first time after their defeat to Scotland.[14] Full members Ireland and
Zimbabwe also missed out on qualification, meaning three of the four full members who took part in the 
knock-out qualification stage did not qualify, with only Sri Lanka progressing.[15] The final qualification 
spot was decided by an eliminator match between associate members Scotland and the Netherlands,[16] 
with the Dutch side taking the final place.[14]  
The tournament took place in ten different stadiums, situated in ten different cities across India. The first 
and second semi-finals were held at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and Eden Gardens in Kolkata 
respectively, while the final took place at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.[7]  
The BCCI provided funding for renovations and refurbishments at stadiums. Himachal Pradesh Cricket 
Association Stadium received a new grass surface, drainage system, seating, and hospitality boxes. 
Wankhede Stadium had upgrades to the outfield, floodlights, corporate boxes, and toilets. M. A. 
Chidambaram Stadium installed new floodlights and relaid two wickets.[17]  
With the autumn scheduling of this World Cup, the ICC instituted protocols for reducing the impact of 
moisture—including dew and rain—on pitch conditions, so that they did not give the team batting second 
an advantage (as had frequently occurred in the 2021 Men’s T20 World Cup). These included using a 
specific wetting agent, and the boundary set at around 70 m (77 yards) at each stadium, with more grass 
on the pitch to encourage seam bowling over spin bowling.[18]

2023.[21] The oldest player of the tournament was Dutch player Wesley Barresi, who was 39 years old, 
while the youngest was Afghan spinner Noor Ahmad, who was 18.[22]

of 100 days to the opening match of the World Cup on 5 October. The group stage started with the match 
between the finalists of the 2019 Cricket World Cup, New Zealand and England, at Narendra Modi 
Stadium.On 9 August 2023, nine fixtures, including the match between India and Pakistan, were 
rescheduled by the ICC.[28] The top seven teams in the tournament, excluding Pakistan who qualify 
automatically as host, qualified for the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy.The ICC released the fixture details on 27 June 2023. 
The host India was the first team to qualify for the semi-finals after their 302-run win against Sri Lanka, 
their seventh successive win in the World Cup.[31] India secured the top place amongst the semi-finalists 
after they beat South Africa by 243 runs on 5 November at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.[32]  
South Africa became the second team to qualify for the semi-finals after Pakistan defeated New Zealand 
on 4 November,[33] with Australia becoming the third team to qualify after defeating Afghanistan on 7 
November.[34] New Zealand confirmed their berth as the fourth team after Pakistan lost their final match 
against England.[35]  
The ICC announced its team of the tournament on 21 November 2023 with Virat Kohli being named as 
player of the tournament,[38] and Rohit Sharma as captain of the team.[39]  
The ICC hosted a "trophy tour" for 100 days prior to the tournament beginning 27 June, with the Cricket 
World Cup Trophy being taken to various locations around the world. The event began with the launching 
of the trophy into the stratosphere and landing at Modi Stadium—becoming the first sports trophy to have 
ever been sent into space.[40]  
The ICC officially announced the mascots for the World Cup in August. The mascots were a male and 
female duo named "Tonk" and "Blaze" from the fictional cricketing utopia "Crictoverse".[41][42]  
The official theme song of the 2023 Cricket World Cup titled "Dil Jashn Bole" (transl. Heart say celebrate) 
was released on 20 September. The song was composed by Pritam, with lyrics by Shloke Lal and Saaveri
Verma. The song was sung by Pritam, Nakash Aziz, Sreerama Chandra, Amit Mishra, Jonita Gandhi, 
Akasa Singh and S. P. Charan.[43] However, the song was subject to backlash and bad reviews.[44]  
Ahead of the tournament, it was reported that an opening ceremony would take place on 4 October 2023 
at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, a day before the opening match at the same venue.[45] 
The ceremony was cancelled and replaced by a closing ceremony ahead of the final.[46] During this a 
drone show was held.[47][48]  
Disney Star served as host broadcaster of the tournament in association with ICC TV;[49] in India, all 
matches were televised by Star Sports and streamed by Disney+ Hotstar, with coverage available in 
English and eight regional languages.[50] Amid competition with JioCinema for domestic cricket 
rights,[51][52] Disney announced that all matches would be available on Disney+ Hotstar for free on 
mobile devices. The broadcasts featured expanded player and Hawk-Eye ball tracking features (building 
upon those introduced in the 2022 men’s T20 World Cup) for visualizing shots and fielding, and dedicated
vertical video feeds of each match designed for streaming on smartphones. Commentary on the ICC’s 
English-language world feed was led by Ricky Ponting and Eoin Morgan among others.[51][49]  
The ICC projected that global live viewing minutes of the tournament had increased by 17% over 
2019.[53] In India, Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) ratings reported that the final was seen
on linear television by 518 million people in India, and Disney reported that streams peaked at 57 million 
concurrent viewers on Hotstar—both setting new records.[52]  
The ICC allocated a pool of US$10 million in prize money for the tournament, with payouts remaining the 
same as the 2019 and 2015 tournaments. Australia, the winning team, received US$4,000,000, the 
runner-up $2,000,000 and the losing semi-finalists $1,600,000. Teams that did not progress past the 
league stage received $100,000 and the winner of each league stage match received $40,000.[54][55]

India Vs Australia World Cup 2023 Final Highlights
Australia abruptly halted India's robust and unbeaten run in the World Cup 2023, securing a record-extending sixth world title in the summit clash at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium. Travis Head's remarkable 5th ODI century, coupled with a gritty fifty from Marnus Labuschagne, shattered India's hopes as Australia chased down 241, winning by six wickets and elongating India's agonizing wait for an ICC title. Pat Cummins joined the illustrious list of Australian World Cup captains, including Allan Border, Steve Waugh, Ponting, and Michael Clarke.

India vs Australia World Cup 2023 Final Highlights and Match Summary

Head, who missed the first four games due to a broken finger, showcased his resilience with a score of 137, emulating Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist as the third Australia batter to hit a hundred in a World Cup final. His innings, reminiscent of Ricky Ponting's beast mode in the 2003 final, became the fourth-highest individual score in a World Cup final.

Australia's chase faced an early setback as India's new-ball duo, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami, dismissed David Warner, Mitchell Marsh, and Steve Smith with just 47 on the board. However, Head and Labuschagne formed an unbroken partnership of 192 runs, making the chase appear more straightforward than anticipated.

In India's innings, despite Rohit Sharma's brisk start, the collective failures of Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer disrupted their plans. Kohli and Rahul struggled to accelerate, eventually falling to Cummins and Mitchell Starc, respectively. Jadeja and Suryakumar Yadav, India's last hope, faced a formidable Australian bowling attack, leading to a total that Australia chased down convincingly. The victory for Australia was a result of a well-executed strategy from the moment they won the toss.

12:45 PM: Witness sporadic appearances of coaching staff members on the field. Imminent commencement of pre-match warm-up routines by players.

1:10:  Triumphs in World Cup finals, especially when a team secures a comprehensive victory, often give rise to intriguing conspiracy theories. The narrative of Ricky Ponting wielding a bat with a mysterious spring, purportedly aiding him in crafting a masterful 140 during the 2003 final against India, is one such example. In the current tournament, India's dominance has sparked speculation ranging from the use of special coins for the toss to unique balls and customized pitches as explanations for their remarkable performance.

1:20 PM:  Pitch Report from Ravi Shastri| "Pitch number five. The same wicket that was used for India vs Pakistan. It's different from that one because it's been left open for quite a long time. It looks very dry, not much rolling. Looks patchy, especially in the areas where spinners will land the ball. I expect it to turn a bit. Dew is uncontrollable. If there's no dew, you could be in trouble. Batting first, and getting runs on the board is premium. But India won't be too bothered either way."

1:25 PM: The pitch is being tended to by the light roller as Bumrah and Shami prepare for their run-ups. Keep an eye on Siraj, who is delivering with full force on the adjacent pitch. Smith and Marnus are analyzing pitches collaboratively. Ashwin and Siraj share a hug, possibly indicating a spontaneous decision, and now Siraj is preparing for his run-up.

1:33 PM: TOSS| Australia have won the toss and have opted to field.

Pat Cummins: "We are gonna have a bowl first. Looks like a dry wicket. Dew is a factor. It gets better to bat on. Tough start to the tournament, haven't really put a foot wrong ever since. It's all set up perfectly. We've played these guys a lot. Same team as the semi-final."

Rohit Sharma: "I would have batted first. Looks a good pitch, a big game, put runs on the board. It's going to be amazing, every time we play here, the crowd come out in large numbers. The biggest occasion in the cricketing event. We have to stay nice and calm. It's a dream come true to be captaining the team in the final. I know what lies in front of us. We need to play well and get the result. You got to make the right decisions on the field. That's something we've done consistently in the last 10 games. We are playing the same team."

1:55 PM:  Both teams out for their respective Anthems.  There's nothing quite like the experience of 100,000 people joining together to sing the anthem. The IAF Suryakiran Aerobatic team also treated the crowd to a breathtaking air show, making the moment even more unforgettable.

2: 00 PM:  Rohit and Shubman Gill have taken their positions at the crease, with Rohit assuming the striking role. The commencement of the final is imminent, and Mitchell Starc is geared up to open the bowling attack. As the anticipation builds, Starc prepares to deliver the first ball to Rohit, with a solitary slip in place. The stage is set for the exciting match to unfold.

Live Cricket Score: India vs Australia World Cup 2023 Final Latest Updates and Summary

After the powerplay, Australia has managed to regain control of the game. Marnus and Travis Head seem to be settling in comfortably. The concerning news for India is that the pitch isn't offering as much turn as anticipated, making it less challenging for the batters.

Inning Break
5:57 PM: Indian Innings Summary| India has been bowled out for 240 in 50 overs. Despite a strong start by Rohit Sharma, who continued his impressive form, the momentum was disrupted with the loss of key wickets. Travis Head's exceptional catch resulted in Rohit's dismissal, and Australia's bowlers, led by Cummins, capitalized on the breakthroughs. Shreyas' early exit and the effective removal of Kohli and Rahul halted India's momentum, causing a dry spell of boundaries.

The Australian pacers adeptly utilized reverse-swing on the slow track, making it challenging for the Indian batters. Despite a below-par but respectable total, India faces a formidable challenge. Australia, with an impressive bowling performance, will be content at the halfway stage and look forward to an aggressive batting display. The stage is set for an intriguing chase, and the next 30 minutes promise an exciting second innings.

Live Cricket Score: India vs Australia World Cup 2023 Final Latest Updates and Summary

The delivery, a good length ball angling in and then moving away late, prompts Warner to reach out for a cut, resulting in a toe-end that goes straight to Kohli at lone slip. A key wicket for India, and Ahmedabad erupts in celebration! Warner departs after scoring 7 runs off 3 balls, including one boundary.

6:53 PM: BUMRAH STRIKES| Mitchell Marsh Caught Behind| AUS 41-2(5)

 It seems like a well-thought-out plan from Team India. After sending Siraj to long-off to offer a single to Marsh in the previous over, Bumrah bowls a short-length delivery outside off stump. Marsh attempts the cut, but there's an under edge, and the ball carries cleanly to KL Rahul at slip.

A strategic move by India! Before the delivery, Virat Kohli was redirected from slip to short mid-wicket, indicating a shift in the field placement. Smith, possibly influenced by the altered field, may have decided to play straight. Bumrah, displaying his intelligence, cleverly introduces an off-cutting slower delivery. Smith misses the ball, and the umpire raises the finger. Interestingly, Smith chooses not to review, despite having a brief discussion with the Head. The replay reveals that the impact was outside the off stump, making it a crucial moment in the game. The question lingers: why didn't Smith opt for a review? India's clever tactics are proving effective against the Australian batters.

India is in serious trouble. Immediately after Travis Head struck a length delivery to Kohli at cover (23.2), a noticeable level of frustration emanated from the Indian cricket legend.

India is nearing the time when hoping for miracles becomes crucial, and that's never an ideal situation. It's a position where control seems elusive, yet India must strive to postpone this inevitability for as long as they can.

Labuschagne's role has been pivotal, marked by the significance of his three boundaries, one of which came off the edge. With Head playing a dominant innings, Labuschagne's primary task has been to stay at the crease and rotate the strike. His initial 10 or 20 balls carried crucial weight, not just in surviving them but in the confidence with which he did so. It was the initial sign that Australia might withstand the unprecedented storm. Given the game's context, Labuschagne's innings should feel like a century, a testament to his contribution.
